# LeonZayas
Progress_Report.Rmd contains a week by week update of the progress made on replicating Figure 3 of the Leon Zayas paper. 

LeonZayasScript.RMD contains the code that I have created in attempts to build Figure 3 on my own.

Final_Report_LZ.Rmd is the final reoprt on the process and replicability of the Leon Zayas paper. This file may need to be knitted to html in order to show the final heat map figure, since it is an html widget created through plotly.
